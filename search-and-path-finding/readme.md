# Search Paths using Algorithms in Python

## Instructions

Use the following command to use the program.
```
python 'path_to_map_file.txt' 'search_algorithm'
```
*path_to_map_file:* Path to the .txt file to be used. The program will not accept anything that is **not** a .txt.
*search_alg:* Search algorithm to be used. Possible oprtions are:
  1. bfs
  2. dfs
  3. astar

## Intro
Pathfinding is a common problem that artificial agents must solve, including mapping services, artificial vehicles, AIs in real-time strategy games, and robots that must navigate in the physical world. For this assignment we will focus on simplified pathfinding problem. Your program will search for the shortest path from a starting location to a goal location on a square grid. However, this grid will have some impassable locations and varying terrain costs that must be accounted for.
